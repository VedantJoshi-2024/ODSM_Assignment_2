## Question: Exploration vs. Exploitation

### (a) Which hyper-parameters in PSO, GA, and SA mainly control exploration vs. exploitation?

1. **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO):**
   - **Inertia Weight (`w`)**: Controls the balance between exploration and exploitation. A higher inertia weight promotes exploration by allowing particles to move more freely, while a lower inertia weight encourages exploitation by focusing on local searches.
   - **Cognitive Coefficient (`c1`)**: Governs the particle's tendency to return to its personal best position, enhancing exploitation.
   - **Social Coefficient (`c2`)**: Governs the particle's tendency to move toward the global best position, promoting exploration.

2. **Genetic Algorithm (GA):**
   - **Crossover Rate**: Determines how often crossover occurs between parent solutions. Higher rates promote exploration by generating diverse offspring.
   - **Mutation Rate**: Controls the frequency of random changes in solutions. Higher mutation rates encourage exploration, while lower rates focus on exploitation of existing solutions.

3. **Simulated Annealing (SA):**
   - **Temperature (`T`)**: The key parameter controlling exploration vs. exploitation. High temperatures allow greater acceptance of worse solutions (exploration), while low temperatures restrict this behavior and focus on refining good solutions (exploitation).
   - **Cooling Schedule**: Determines how quickly the temperature decreases. A slower cooling schedule allows more exploration, while a faster schedule focuses on exploitation.

### (b) How does tuning these parameters alter the search behavior?

1. **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO):**
   - Example 1: Increasing the inertia weight (`w`) early in the optimization process allows particles to explore a larger area of the search space, reducing the risk of premature convergence.
   - Example 2: Decreasing `c2` (social coefficient) and increasing `c1` (cognitive coefficient) biases particles toward their personal best positions, enhancing local search and exploitation.

2. **Genetic Algorithm (GA):**
   - Example 1: A high crossover rate can generate diverse offspring, enabling better exploration of the search space. However, if too high, it may disrupt good solutions prematurely.
   - Example 2: Increasing mutation rate introduces randomness that can help escape local minima but may also destabilize convergence if overused.

3. **Simulated Annealing (SA):**
   - Example 1: Starting with a high temperature (`T`) allows acceptance of worse solutions, enabling broad exploration of the search space.
   - Example 2: Using a slow cooling schedule maintains higher temperatures for longer periods, promoting extensive exploration before transitioning to exploitation.
